"""

Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No index satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

        Goal: find the pivot index of an array, the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of the right index.

        length of the nums list could be 1
        numbers could be negative

        Task:
        Could you keep track of the sum of the right and left numbers?

        Solution: Assume one side of the sum is the total of the nums array, taking one number out to the other side will increase the sum of that side and reduce the sum of the current side. Could you check each swap of the number, 
        if the left and right sides are equal, return the current index as the pivot index? Otherwise, when it reaches the last index of the list, return -1.
