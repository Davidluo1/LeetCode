        Goal: return the length of the longest consecutive element sequence.

        Must be in O(N) runtime -> Iterate the nums array once.

        Approach:
        1. Sorted the nums array.
        2. Iterate through the sorted nums array, use a variable to track the current longest consecutive sequence.
        3. Update the longest consecutive seuqence and return it at the end.
