"""

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

        Goal: return the frequency of the characters from the given string s.

        Rules:
        1. The character that appears the most gets to output first
        2. Upper and lower case sensitive
        3. Same frequency of the characters does not need to be sorted

        Easy case:
        when the length of the string s is 1, return s

        Case: abaa

        Tool:
        - dictionary

        Solution:
        1. Iterate through the string s and store the count of each characters and digits.
        2. Sort the dictionary by its count/value (lambda / sort).
        3. Iterate through the sorted dictionary and store the number of characters and digits into a string varible
        4. Return the output string.
